your app icons. Have you ever thought of organize your mobile apps into archives? Probably, you did(if you don't want to spend *HOURS* finding

# Bye

When talking about customizing/hacking iphone, google usually sends us to `iphone jailbreak`, but there is definitely some technical bars/safety concerns for many users to do that. As iOS is [closed source (https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_source), developers tend to do different hacks to acquire higher permission for more control, but we can always find some useful tricks without too much hassle. Give the `assistive touch` a look if you prefer single hand operation on your mobile.

Have fun and rock with your iPhone!
