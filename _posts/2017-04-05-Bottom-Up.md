# Background
I've been looking for a new job for quite while, it's not as smooth as i was first expected. In fact, it's way worse than i could imagine,
and might be another one of the best lessons i've learned so far.

# Reason
The difficulty comes from lacking of understanding of:

a) the hiring process starting from the scanning of resume\
b) measurements used to justify qualified candidates\
c) the importance of cultural fit during typical software engineer interviews\
Each parts play their own role across the whole process, you're gonna pay tuition if underestimated any of them.

# Emotion
It's kinda hard to accurately capture all the feelings. Angry, frustration and self-skeptical.

# Action
Now, i'm right at the *bottom* of page, already nothing to lose.

# Conclusion
Good reading materials i came across those days:
1. [Hiring Is Broken â€“ My interview experience in the tech industry](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11579757)
2. [What is the best career advice for a software developer to earn a higher salary?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-career-advice-for-a-software-developer-to-earn-a-higher-salary)
